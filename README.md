# SendEmails
The solution has the followion projects:
1. Api -> This project has the Api to send emails
2. Core -> This project defines the models
3. Infrastructure -> This project has the code to integrate with database
4. Web -> This is the web application
5. Tests -> Project for tests

Before you can run the application you need to set your configuration in the database. 
The table "EmailProviderParam" holds the configuration parameters.

To run the application start the Api project then you can send email with the Web project.
